## COMP20 Assignment Repository
### Spring 2018

**What is this purpose of this repository?** 

This repository showcases the work I did for assignments and labs in COMP20 (Web Programming) as a Mechanical Engineering undergrad at Tufts University. It serves as a timeline that shows my progress through the course, as I implemented the concepts and fundamentals of web programming we learned.  

**My favourite assignment was...**

The client side of NotUber was my favourite assignment. As someone who is very visual, I enjoyed using APIs to build something that is user friendly and intuitive. It was also exciting to figure out how a real life product has been put together, with tools that I had recently learned to use. While I found the server assignment interesting for similar reasons, back end was not as easy or intuitive for me to grasp. 

**How much have I grown since the start of this semester?** 

My knowledge and understanding of computer science has significantly developed while taking this class. Having only taken introductory CS (COMP11 during fall semester my freshman year, I'm a senior now) I did not feel like I had the hard skills to make something that is complete and usable.  Although COMP20 did not teach me everything that I need to know, to make a good web app (arguably no single class could), I feel like I now have the ability to continue learning and developing the skills myself.  

**What was the most important thing that I learned in this course?**  

In addition to all the fundamentals of web programming, I learned about the directions that I can take concepts from this class in, whether on the client or server side. As someone who is partcularly interested in client side, I would now like to explore concepts such as visualizations, and the fundamentals of human-compter interactions. Additionally, the class served as a refresher on many non computer science skills. I was reminded on the value of strong teamwork and communication (during our group project) and learning to learn (which we needed to do for basically all assignments), which I will take with me into my life beyond college.   

**I would like to delve deeper into...** 

I would love to delve deeper into both the client and server side of things. Within client side, I'd like to learn more about the areas mentioned above. While I did enjoy client side more, I don't think I can consider myself a full fledged web developer before also understanding the intricacies of back end. The sky seems to be the limit with servers, which do the heavy lifting for most websites. Thus, I really want to develop and further my understanding of them.
